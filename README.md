# Data Conversion Calculator

## Overview

The Data Conversion Calculator is a versatile tool designed to convert numbers from one base to another. It supports conversion between bases 2, 8, 10, and 16. The challenge of base 16, with its alphanumeric numbering system (0-9, A-F), is elegantly addressed within this application.

## Problem Solving Strategy

### High-Level Approach

The solution to this problem is executed through three main steps:

1. **Validate User Input**: Ensure that the user's input is valid and fits the selected base.

2. **Convert to Decimal**: Convert the input from the source base to decimal.

3. **Convert to Target Base**: Transform the decimal representation to the desired target base.

This approach is designed to avoid hard-coding individual conversions for each combination of bases. Instead, it follows a unified process where the user input is first converted to decimal and then adapted to the target base. This method allows for the use of two primary functions that can handle all conversions, regardless of the source and target bases. 

### Base Conversion

- **Source Base to Decimal**: This conversion is achieved through a generic weighted multiplication. Each digit in the input number is multiplied by the power of the source base, determined by its position within the number. The results of these multiplications are then summed. The least significant digit is multiplied by the source base raised to the power of 0, and the most significant digit is multiplied by the source base raised to the power of n - 1, where n is the number of digits.

- **Decimal to Target Base**: The conversion from decimal to the target base utilizes the successive division method. The base to divide by is provided as a parameter, enabling the same function to work seamlessly with any target base.

## Conclusion

This approach exemplifies a generic and flexible strategy for performing base conversions between different numbering systems. It eliminates the need for specific conversions for each base pair, and future adaptation to additional bases requires only minor modifications to the source code.

## Usage

To use the Data Conversion Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Input the number you want to convert and specify its current base.

2. Specify the target base to which you want to convert the number.

3. Click the "Convert" button to obtain the converted result.
